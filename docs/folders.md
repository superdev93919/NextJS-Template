![atomic_design](./_assets/atomic_design.png)

### Atomic
Atom are the base componenent of the design system, such as: Button, text, labels, forms etc... 

They are located in our structure in the following location: `src/lib/components/atoms/`.

### Molecules
This is generally a groupes of atomes that work together to handle a specific task (such as a form with the search button ) or having a componet more complex that doesn't fit well in an atomic component. 

They are located in our structure in the following location: `src/lib/components/molecules/`.

### Layouts
Layouts is a component that usually include the content of a page, for example a navbar, sidebar, app-shell, panel etc...

They are located in our structure in the following location: `src/lib/components/layouts/`.

### Sections
Sections is part of a page, the page being devided in multiple section (example: header, about, our team,...) and contain themself some atomes or molecules.

They are located in a folder of a page ([See Routing from NextJS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals)).

### Pages
Pages contain a set of section or integrate molecules & atoms for the smallest page. the Page is usually part of the layout.

They are located in a folder of a page ([See Routing from NextJS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals)).
